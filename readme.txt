This is a web app dedicated to my hobby of collecting seals from shrines and temples in Japan which are known as "goshuin". It is still a work-in-progress passion project so some key functionality and features may be missing at this time. This website is made with node.js, the Express framework and MongoDB.

Functionality
===================

Users can...
    - View goshuins
    - Make a new account
    - Log in with a newly created account
    - Login with Facebook
    - Create new goshuin entries
    - Edit past goshuin entries
    - Delete past goshuin entries
    
Future plans
===================

Users will be able to...
    - Create comments
    - Edit past comments
    - Delete past comments
    - Upload images to the website
    - Log in with Reddit
    - Post to social media
    - Use Google Maps to display where the goshuin was obtained
    
Other future plans
